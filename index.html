            <h2>It was busy, but it was great!</h2>

            <p>In order to graduate this Fall, I had to make sure and take lots of courses and fill some hours. I spent much, much time on coursework, but I had some time for fun too. My courses were varied and interesting &#40;good for making me in to a vt-shaped student?&#41; </p>

            <h3>Topics in Women&#39;s Literature</h3>
            <p>The theme for Jane Wemhoener&#39;s version of this course was &#34;Women and Madness.&#34; We looked at the different ways that women have been treated as &#39;mad&#39; throughout history and ways that literature reflects this. Works like <i>The Bell Jar</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> show the importance of female perspectives over time. Some things have changed for the better&#59; some haven't. </p>
            <h3>Language and the Mind</h3>
            <p> In Dr. Abby Walker&#39;s course, which was cross listed with Psychology, we learned about how neurology and psychology affect the way we percieve and produce language. Linguistics isn&#39;t my favorite field, but this class was interesting and a good example of how branching out within <em>English</em> can be helpful in to your core classes.</p>
            <h3>Senior Seminar&#58; Irish Literature</h3>
            <p>Peter Graham taught this edition of the Senior Seminar for Literature majors, which I thoroughly enjoyed. We studied Irish authors from the last century or so including Joyce, Yeats, Doyle and Heaney. I did my final research on James Joyce and reflections of Catholic Identity in his fiction.  </p>
            <h3>Creative Writing&#58; Poetry</h3>
            <p>Having a published poet for a teacher is <em>pretty</em> cool. Bob Hicok challenged us to write for, and analyze for big groups in this class. Beyond technical learning, this class was about being comfortable with our own poetry and talking about others&#39;.</p>
            <h3>Acts of Interpretation</h3>
            <p>In a somewhat PTW class, Dr. Sano-Franchini helped make me a better and more analytical writer. This class was great for being a better writer in all aspects, creative or more technical. </p>
            <h3>Geography of Wine</h3>
            <p>And the best comes last...Professor Boyer's <em>second</em> most popular class introduced me to one of the biggest and ever-expanding industries in the world&#58; wine. I got a job out of it! Wine is fun.</p>
